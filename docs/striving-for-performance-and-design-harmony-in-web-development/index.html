        <p>In modern web development, a fine balance between performance and user-centric design is key. It doesn't just enhance visitor retention; it deepens their interaction with the content. My recent project provided me a deep dive into achieving this delicate balance. Here is a recount of my experience and the insights that I've gained.</p>
<h2>The Task at Hand</h2>
<p>The project involved transforming a site initially built using 11ty and Forestry CMS. The goal was clear: transitioning to Cloudcannon and securing top-notch performance metrics across the board.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/striving-for-performance-and-design-harmony-in-web-development/Wop_ZSkJqs-300.avif 300w, /striving-for-performance-and-design-harmony-in-web-development/Wop_ZSkJqs-600.avif 600w, /striving-for-performance-and-design-harmony-in-web-development/Wop_ZSkJqs-750.avif 750w, /striving-for-performance-and-design-harmony-in-web-development/Wop_ZSkJqs-900.avif 900w, /striving-for-performance-and-design-harmony-in-web-development/Wop_ZSkJqs-1200.avif 1200w, /striving-for-performance-and-design-harmony-in-web-development/Wop_ZSkJqs-1400.avif 1400w" sizes="100vw"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/striving-for-performance-and-design-harmony-in-web-development/Wop_ZSkJqs-300.jpeg 300w, /striving-for-performance-and-design-harmony-in-web-development/Wop_ZSkJqs-600.jpeg 600w, /striving-for-performance-and-design-harmony-in-web-development/Wop_ZSkJqs-750.jpeg 750w, /striving-for-performance-and-design-harmony-in-web-development/Wop_ZSkJqs-900.jpeg 900w, /striving-for-performance-and-design-harmony-in-web-development/Wop_ZSkJqs-1200.jpeg 1200w, /striving-for-performance-and-design-harmony-in-web-development/Wop_ZSkJqs-1400.jpeg 1400w" sizes="100vw"><img alt="Website score on webperf" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/striving-for-performance-and-design-harmony-in-web-development/Wop_ZSkJqs-300.jpeg" width="1400" height="844"></picture>
<em>Website score on <a href="https://webperf.se/">webperf.se</a>, a service that measures the performance of sites in Sweden.</em></p>
<h2>Crafting the Developer Experience</h2>
<p>A well crafted website not only looks good but is also built upon pillars of performance, accessibility, and best practices. Here, tools like <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a> offer an appealing promise of swift development. However, every tool has its caveats. In the case of Tailwind, it produced CSS with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">custom properties</a>, a feature that at that point was yet to be <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-variables/">standardized</a>. Instead of letting this be a setback, I explored alternatives to establish an equally efficient and issue-free developer environment.</p>
<h2>Embracing Modular CSS</h2>
<p>Let's dive a bit into the CSS. A modular CSS structure promises maintainability and scalability in design, paving the way for rapid feature deployment and updates. It ensures that while each component stands on its own, it is harmonious with overarching design. The structure we employed embodies this principle:</p>
<pre><code>component-library/
├─ components/
│  └─ sample/
│     ├─ sample.bookshop.yml
│     ├─ sample.test.js
│     ├─ sample.scss
│     └─ sample.eleventy.liquid
└─ shared/
   └─ styles/
      ├─ global.scss
      └─ variables.scss
</code></pre>
<p>But what makes this structure dynamic? Enter SCSS. A powerful extension of the traditional CSS, SCSS bestows developers with features like variables and nested rules. While vanilla CSS has its merits, SCSS allows for a more dynamic and fluid styling approach. Our build process uses tools like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass">Sass</a> to consolidate and optimize SCSS files, ensuring seamless style deployment. The journey from SCSS to optimized CSS follows these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the SCSS files.</li>
<li>Compile them into regular CSS.</li>
<li>Optimize the resultant CSS.</li>
<li>Store it for deployment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Discovery</h3>
<p>To begin the journey of styling optimization, we must first pinpoint where all the styles reside. Utilizing <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-glob">fast-glob</a>, we efficiently traverse the file system, seeking out the SCSS files. Imagine wanting to identify all <code>.scss</code> and <code>.css</code> files within the <code>src</code> directory. Here is how it would look:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">const</span> fg <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'fast-glob'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><br><span class="token keyword">const</span> entries <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">await</span> <span class="token function">fg</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'src/**/*.{css,scss}'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></code></pre>
<h3>Compilation</h3>
<p>Having identified our list of SCSS files, the next step is compilation. Conventionally, you'd find a &quot;main&quot; SCSS file that <code>@import</code>s other SCSS files, setting up a clear hierarchy. Compiling this main file processes all the imported files in the order of their appearance.</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">const</span> sass <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'sass'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><br><span class="token keyword">const</span> output <span class="token operator">=</span> sass<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">renderSync</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> <span class="token literal-property property">file</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">'path/to/main.scss'</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></code></pre>
<p>A more flexible alternative to the traditional method is dynamic compilation, as exemplified by the Bookshop sass bundler:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">const</span> sassInput <span class="token operator">=</span> entries<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">map</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">file</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token template-string"><span class="token template-punctuation string">`</span><span class="token string">@import "</span><span class="token interpolation"><span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">${</span>file<span class="token interpolation-punctuation punctuation">}</span></span><span class="token string">";</span><span class="token template-punctuation string">`</span></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">join</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'\n'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><br><span class="token keyword">const</span> output <span class="token operator">=</span> sass<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">renderSync</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> <span class="token literal-property property">data</span><span class="token operator">:</span> sassInput <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></code></pre>
<p>Here, we create an in-memory virtual SCSS file that imports every SCSS file detected. By compiling it, we incorporate all unique component styles.</p>
<h3>Post-Processing</h3>
<p>Compilation, while crucial, is just one part of the equation. We must enhance and optimize the compiled styles. This is where powerful tools like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss">PostCSS</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cssnano">cssnano</a> come into play.</p>
<p>PostCSS doesn't merely refine styles; it transforms them. The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer">Autoprefixer</a> plugin is a prime example, appending vendor prefixes based <a href="https://caniuse.com/">Can I use</a> data, ensuring consistent, cross-browser compatibility.
While PostCSS refines, cssnano tightens. It compresses, strips, and trims the CSS into its leanest form.</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">const</span> postcss <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'postcss'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><br><span class="token keyword">const</span> cssnano <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'cssnano'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><br><span class="token keyword">const</span> autoprefixer <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'autoprefixer'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><br><br><span class="token keyword">const</span> processedCSS <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">await</span> <span class="token function">postcss</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span>autoprefixer<span class="token punctuation">,</span> cssnano<span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><br>    <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">process</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>output<span class="token punctuation">.</span>css<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> <br>        <span class="token literal-property property">from</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">'input.css'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>  <span class="token comment">// source file (it can be virtual)</span><br>        <span class="token literal-property property">to</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">'output.css'</span>    <span class="token comment">// destination file</span><br>    <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br><br><span class="token keyword">const</span> finalCss <span class="token operator">=</span> processedCSS<span class="token punctuation">.</span>css<span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
<p>Together, PostCSS and cssnano guarantee that our CSS is not only adaptable but also blazing fast.</p>
<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>Having navigated the maze of style optimization, our last step is simple: writing our refined and optimized CSS to a file.</p>
<h2>Render Time</h2>
<p>Ensuring fast page rendering is crucial for a seamless user experience. To realize this, we must permit the browser to begin rendering even as resources are still in the loading phase. The primary challenge lies in eliminating layout shifts and avoiding any sudden visual disturbances. For optimal performance, resource loading and deployment must be carefully managed, particularly given the potential influence on the page during their loading phase.</p>
<h3>Font display</h3>
<p>While custom fonts can undeniably elevate a website's aesthetic appeal, they may impede rendering speed. Yet, with the technique of font swapping, it's possible to strike a balance between aesthetics and efficiency.</p>
<p>By integrating font swapping in our CSS, the browser is directed to utilize a system or fallback font while the page is still loading. This circumvents the scenario where users find themselves gazing at an empty space. Once the custom font has been fully loaded, the browser subtly switches to it, ensuring that the design's integrity remains uncompromised without any delay for the user. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-display">font-display</a> descriptor facilitates this:</p>
<pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css"><span class="token property">font-display</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> swap</code></pre>
<p>Enhancing font loading further, preloading the font primes the browser early about its significance, allowing for efficient downloading. The following method achieves this without introducing any JavaScript to our site.</p>
<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>link</span> <span class="token attr-name">rel</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>preload<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">href</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>/fonts/font.woff2<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">as</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>font<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">type</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>font/woff2<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">crossorigin</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></code></pre>
<p>This strategy prompts early font loading without hindering the rendering process, offering a blend of performance and design.</p>
<h2>Critical CSS</h2>
<p>The term 'above-the-fold' originates from newspaper design, referring to the content immediately visible when a page loads, without the need for scrolling. By prioritizing the delivery of the critical CSS necessary for this portion, we ensure the user's first impression is swift and seamless.</p>
<p>We do this by inlining these critical styles directly into the HTML's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and thereby allowing the browser to immediately render the immediate content without having to wait for the entire stylesheet to load. The npm package, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/critical">critical</a>, offers a simplified solution:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">const</span> critical <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'critical'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><br><br>critical<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">generate</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><br>  <span class="token literal-property property">inline</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>         <span class="token comment">// Will inline the generated CSS into the HTML</span><br>  <span class="token literal-property property">base</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">'dist/'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>        <span class="token comment">// Your base directory</span><br>  <span class="token literal-property property">src</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">'index.html'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>    <span class="token comment">// Source HTML file to be processed</span><br>  <span class="token literal-property property">width</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token number">1300</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>          <span class="token comment">// Viewport width</span><br>  <span class="token literal-property property">height</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token number">900</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>          <span class="token comment">// Viewport height</span><br>  <span class="token literal-property property">ignore</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>             <span class="token comment">// Rules to ignore, e.g., font-face which can be hefty</span><br>    <span class="token literal-property property">atrule</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token string">'@font-face'</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><br>  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><br><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></code></pre>
<p>In the above example, the <code>index.html</code> file is analyzed to determine the styles needed for its above-the-fold content, and are subsequently inlined.</p>
<p>This strategy provides several benefits. It accelerates the initial content rendering, allowing earlier user interaction, and side-steps render blocking delays.</p>
<h2>Layout shifts</h2>
<p>Responsive design has revolutionized how sites adjust across devices, but it's not without hurdles. For instance, while strategies like asynchronous content loading shows a lot of 'promise' — pun very much intended — it can occasionally result in unexpected layout shifts. Such shifts disorient users, leading to unintended clicks and detracting from a seamless browsing experience.</p>
<p>To address these issues, forward-thinking solutions are essential. A hands-on approach is to establish size constraints for elements that might adjust with incoming content. As an example, if a font swap alters an element's dimensions, the application of <code>min-height</code> and <code>min-width</code> becomes a vital safeguard. This strategy ensures that our content is primed to adapt to any changes, be they CMS updates or device reconfigurations, whilst maintaining a steadfast structure.</p>
<h2>Responsive Images</h2>
<p>As screen sizes become more diverse, the need for responsive image techniques grows. Choosing the right image size not only boosts a website's visual appeal but also ensures optimal performance. Here, the <code>sizes</code> attribute stands out.</p>
<p>The <code>sizes</code> attribute allows us to guide the browser on the image display size for varying viewport conditions. By defining both upper and lower limits with this attribute, we ensure the best-suited image variant gets loaded.</p>
<p>For instance, with the <code>sizes</code> attribute, we can dictate how the image adapts across different device widths. Here is how it works:</p>
<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html">(min-width: 1280px) 426px, <br>(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1280px) 33vw, <br>(min-width: 640px) and (max-width: 768px) 50vw, <br>(max-width: 640px) 100vw</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>For screens wider than 1280 pixels, the image will be displayed at a fixed width of 426 pixels.</li>
<li>For screens between 768 and 1280 pixels, the image will take up 33% of the viewport width.</li>
<li>On screens ranging from 640 to 768 pixels, the image will cover half the viewport width.</li>
<li>For a screen width of 640 pixels or less, the image will span the entire viewport width.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside the <code>sizes</code> attribute, it's worth highlighting the value of <code>srcset</code>. While we dictate display conditions with <code>sizes</code>, <code>srcset</code> lists multiple image versions, letting the browser select the optimal one based on device specifics.</p>
<p>The result is crisp visuals across devices, faster page loads, saved energy, and reduced bandwidth use.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>At first glance, embedding inline CSS directly into HTML appears to be a straightforward approach to styling. Yet, this simplicity can be deceptive, as it opens up potential security vulnerabilities and challenges, particularly when the CSS undergoes changes during development.</p>
<p>To counter such vulnerabilities, modern browsers have incorporated a vital security feature called the Content Security Policy (CSP) Header. This feature delineates where various content types, be it scripts, styles, or images, can be sourced from, ensuring that only content from trusted sources gets executed or rendered.</p>
<p>The significance of CSP becomes even clearer when we consider threats like cross-site scripting. This nefarious tactic allows attackers to inject code into web pages that unsuspecting users then view. Not only can it jeopardize user data, but it can also transform reputable sites into hubs of malicious activity. The CSP stands as a safeguard against these and other similar threats.</p>
<p>Now, when one chooses to go the route of inlining CSS, a specific hash of the content needs to be added to the CSP header, signaling to the browser that this content is legitimate. But there is a catch: should the styling undergo any alterations during development, which is often the case, the associated hash needs a recalculation and subsequent update on the server. This step, often done manually, is both labor-intensive and susceptible to errors.</p>
<p>A possible workaround is the use of a nonce — a unique, one-time token. However, this method demands a dynamic setting, such as a Node server. Given that our platform is tailored to serve only static files, venturing into such complexities is unwarranted.</p>
<h2>Automation</h2>
<p>We can make this process smoother and hands-free by utilizing a Python script during deployment:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, we scan for HTML files: Store the deployment in a processing directory and sift through it, identifying the HTML files.</li>
<li>Detect Inline Styles: The script then parses the HTML files for inline styles.</li>
<li>Hash Calculation: For each detected style, the script computes its hash.</li>
<li>Config File Generation: Using a predefined template, the script produces a new configuration file for the site. Within this file, a placeholder is replaced with the calculated <code>style-src</code> hashes.</li>
<li>Deployment and Validation: A critical step in the process. Before pushing any changes, the script runs a series of tests and checks, validates the syntax and other parameters. Only when the validation succeeds are the deployment files sent to their designated destination. Subsequently, the configuration file is refreshed, and the server reloads it.</li>
<li>Reversion: Should any test fail or any irregularities emerge, all changes are reverted to guarantee the website’s integrity.</li>

<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<p>By harnessing these strategies, we create sites that excel both visually and functionally. Their elegance lies not just in design but in robust mechanics. Our task is two-fold: crafting aesthetically pleasing experiences while ensuring they remain performant, secure, and sustainable.</p>
<p>In the end, the elegance of a website isn't just in its visible design but also in its underlying mechanics. As designers and developers, our goal is to master both fronts, crafting experiences that are not only beautiful but are also performant, secure, and sustainable.</p>
<p>With this, I would like to thank my colleagues at factor10 from whom I learn every day. I would also like to thank my co-workers Anders and Peter who have worked alongside me for their excellent work.</p>
